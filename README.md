# Aims

* Implement some useful helper functions, such as addition, multiplication for encrypted values.
* Based on the [TFHE library](https://github.com/tfhe/tfhe)

# Plan

* First use the origin TFHE library as the backend
* Then, I hope to develop a faster implementation using [NFLib](https://github.com/quarkslab/NFLlib)
